        <p>The addition of quinoa gives these burgers a boost of fiber and keeps them tender. They’re very freezer-friendly so feel free to double the batch for future reheat-and-eat meals.</p>
        
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. ground turkey</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked quinoa</li>
            <li>1 tsp. garlic powder (or minced garlic)</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely diced onion (or more to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tsp. Italian or Greek seasoning</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp. black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>2 oz. crumbled goat cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. coconut oil or avocado oil, divided</li>
        </ul>  
        
        <h3>directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except goat cheese. Mix well using a large spoon or your hands.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in crumbled goat cheese until evenly distributed, but still intact for the most part. Shape mixture into 8 patties.</li>
            <li>Place patties on a pan and bake in oven for about 30 minutes.</li>

        </ol>

        <h4>notes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To freeze burgers: Cook burgers as directed and cool completely. Place in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer-safe container for storage. Allow burgers to thaw overnight in the fridge. Reheat in the toaster oven or oven.</li>
            <li>Sub in any green you want or have on hand. It doesn't have to be spinach.</li>
            <li>I added worcestershire sauce to the mixture.</li>
            <li>Leave the cheese out and top the burgers with it when they're done if you prefer, or leave cheese out of it completely. I found these flavorful enough without.</li>

        </ol>
